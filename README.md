## 1. Introduction to Collections
**Duration:** 9:57  
This section introduces you to the fundamental concepts of collections in C#. It covers the importance of collections and how they are used to manage groups of related objects efficiently.

## 2. Generic vs Non-Generic Collections
**Duration:** 11:09  
Understand the differences between generic and non-generic collections, including performance benefits, type safety, and ease of use.

## 3. Working with Lists
Learn about one of the most commonly used collections in C#, the `List`. This section includes:
- What is a List? (5:14)
- Inserting and removing elements from a List.
- Looping through Lists.
- Aggregating and filtering data using LINQ with Lists.
- Sorting, searching, and working with custom objects.

**Key Topics:**
- Adding/Removing Elements
- Aggregation with LINQ
- Filtering Data
- Sorting Methods
- Contains, Exists, Find, and Any methods.

## 4. HashTable in C#
**Duration:** 12:55  
The **Hashtable** stores key-value pairs, and this section dives into how to work with a Hashtable, its use cases, and its difference from other similar collections.

**Key Topics:**
- Working with HashTables.
- Differences between HashTable and Dictionary.

## 5. Dictionaries in C#
**Duration:** 5:39  
The **Dictionary** is another key-value pair collection, but it is type-safe and more efficient than a Hashtable. This section provides an in-depth understanding of Dictionaries, including advanced LINQ queries and the `TryGetValue` method.

**Key Topics:**
- Using and working with Dictionaries.
- LINQ with Dictionaries.
- Difference between HashTable and Dictionary.

## 6. HashSet in C#
This section covers **HashSet**, an unordered collection of unique elements. It is ideal for scenarios where you need to manage a distinct set of items without duplicates.

**Key Topics:**
- Checking for existence in HashSet.
- Removing elements from HashSet.
- Using HashSet to remove duplicates from collections.
- LINQ operations with HashSet.

## 7. Set Operations with HashSet
Learn how to perform fundamental set operations using **HashSet**, including:
- Union Operation (2:21)
- Intersection Operation (1:57)
- Difference Operation (2:29)
- Symmetric Difference (3:12)

## 8. Comparing Sets with HashSet
Compare different sets of data using **HashSet** and explore operations like:
- `SetEquals` to check for equality.
- `IsSubsetOf` and `IsSupersetOf` for checking set relationships.
- Using `Overlaps` to find common elements between sets.
